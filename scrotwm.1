.Sh NAME
.Nm scrotwm
.Nd window manager for X11
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm scrotwm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the way so that
valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and
fast.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from its configuration file,
.Pa scrotwm.conf .
See the
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES
section below.
.Pp
The following notation is used throughout this page:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm M
Meta
.It Cm S
Shift
.It Aq Cm Name
Named key
.It Cm M1
Mouse button 1
.It Cm M3
Mouse button 3
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is very simple in its use.
Most of the actions are initiated via key or mouse bindings.
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below for defaults and customizations.
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
.Nm
first tries to open the user specific file,
.Pa ~/.scrotwm.conf .
If that file is unavailable,
it then tries to open the global configuration file
.Pa /etc/scrotwm.conf .
.Pp
The format of the file is \*(Ltkeyword\*(Gt = \*(Ltsetting\*(Gt.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl color_focus = red
.Pp
Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.
.Pp
The file supports the following keywords:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "title_class_enabledXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm color_focus
Border color of the currently focussed window.
.It Cm color_unfocus
Border color of unfocussed windows.
.It Cm bar_enabled
Enable or disable status bar.
.It Cm bar_border Ns Bq Ar x
Color of the status bar border in screen
.Ar x .
.It Cm bar_color Ns Bq Ar x
Color of the status bar window in screen
.Ar x .
.It Cm bar_font_color Ns Bq Ar x
Color of the font in status bar in screen
.Ar x .
.It Cm bar_font
Status bar font.
.It Cm bar_action
External script that populates additional information in the status bar,
such as battery life.
.It Cm bar_delay
Update frequency, in seconds, of external script that populates the status bar.
.It Cm stack_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the current stacking algorithm in the status bar.
.It Cm clock_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the clock in the status bar.
Disable by setting to 0
so a custom clock could be used in the bar_action script.
.It Cm dialog_ratio
Some applications have dialogue windows that are too small to be useful.
This ratio is the screen size to what they will be resized.
For example, 0.6 is 60% of the physical screen size.
.It Cm region
Allocates a custom region, removing any autodetected regions which occupy the same
space on the screen.
Defined in the format screen[<idx>]:WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y,
e.g.\& screen[1]:800x1200+0+0.
.It Cm term_width
Set a preferred minimum width for the terminal
If this value is greater than 0,
.Nm
will attempt to adjust the font sizes in the terminal to keep the terminal
width above this number as the window is resized.
Only
.Xr xterm 1
is currently supported.
The
.Xr xterm 1
binary must not be setuid or setgid, which it is by default on most systems.
Users may need to set program[term] (see the
.Sx PROGRAMS
section) to use an alternate copy of the
.Xr xterm 1
binary without the setgid bit set.
.It Cm title_class_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the window class in the status bar.
Enable by setting to 1
.It Cm title_name_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the window title in the status bar.
Enable by setting to 1
.It Cm modkey
Change mod key.
Mod1 is generally the ALT key and Mod4 is the windows key on a PC.
.It Cm focus_mode
Using a value of follow_cursor will make the window manager focus the window
under the mouse when switching workspaces and creating windows.
.It Cm disable_border
Remove border when bar is disabled and there is only one window on the screen.
.It Cm program Ns Bq Ar p
Define new action to spawn a program
.Ar p .
See the
.Sx PROGRAMS
section below.
.It Cm bind Ns Bq Ar x
Bind key combo to action
.Ar x .
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below.
.It Cm quirk Ns Bq Ar c:n
Add "quirk" for windows with class
.Ar c
and name
.Ar n .
See the
.Sx QUIRKS
section below.
.El
.Pp
Colors need to be specified per the
.Xr XQueryColor 3
specification and fonts need to be specified per the
.Xr XQueryFont 3
specification.
.Sh PROGRAMS
.Nm
allows you to define custom actions to launch programs of your choice and then
bind them the same as with built-in actions.
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below.
.Pp
The default programs are described below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "screenshot_wind" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm term
xterm
.It Cm screenshot_all
screenshot.sh full
.It Cm screenshot_wind
screenshot.sh window
.It Cm lock
xlock
.It Cm initscr
initscreen.sh
.It Cm menu
dmenu_run \-fn $bar_font \-nb $bar_color \-nf $bar_font_color \-sb $bar_border \-sf $bar_color
.El
.Pp
Custom programs in the configuration file are specified as follows:
.Pp
.Dl program[<name>] = <progpath> [<arg> [... <arg>]]
.Pp
.Aq name
is any identifier that does not conflict with a built-in action or keyword,
.Aq progpath
is the desired program, and
.Aq arg
is zero or more arguments to the program.
.Pp
The following variables represent settable values in
.Nm
(see the
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES
section above),
and may be used in the
.Aq arg
fields and will be substituted for values at the time the program is spawned:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "$bar_font_color" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm $bar_border
.It Cm $bar_color
.It Cm $bar_font
.It Cm $bar_font_color
.It Cm $color_focus
.It Cm $color_unfocus
.El
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
program[ff] = /usr/local/bin/firefox http://scrotwm.org/
bind[ff] = Mod+f # Now Mod+F launched firefox
.Ed
.Pp
To undo the previous:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind[] = Mod+f
program[ff] =
.Ed
.Pp

Custom bindings in the configuration file are specified as follows:
.Pp
.Dl bind[<action>] = <keys>
.Pp
.Aq action
is one of the actions listed above (or empty) and

(MOD, Mod1, Shift, etc.) and one or more normal keys
(b, space, etc.), separated by "+".
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind[reset] = Mod4+q # bind Windows-key + q to reset
bind[] = Mod1+q # unbind Alt + q
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple key combinations may be bound to the same action.
.Sh QUIRKS
.Nm
provides "quirks" which handle windows that must be treated specially
in a tiling window manager, such as some dialogs and fullscreen apps.
.Pp
The default quirks are described below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "OpenOffice.org N.M:VCLSalFrame<TAB>XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Firefox\-bin:firefox\-bin
TRANSSZ
.It Firefox:Dialog
FLOAT
.It Gimp:gimp
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It MPlayer:xv
FLOAT + FULLSCREEN
.It OpenOffice.org 2.4:VCLSalFrame
FLOAT
.It OpenOffice.org 3.1:VCLSalFrame
FLOAT
.It pcb:pcb
FLOAT
.It xine:Xine Window
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It xine:xine Panel
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It xine:xine Video Fullscreen Window
FULLSCREEN + FLOAT
.It Xitk:Xitk Combo
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It Xitk:Xine Window
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It XTerm:xterm
XTERM_FONTADJ
.El
.Pp
The quirks themselves are described below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XTERM_FONTADJ<TAB>XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It FLOAT
This window should not be tiled, but allowed to float freely.
.It TRANSSZ
Adjusts size on transient windows that are too small using dialog_ratio
(see
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES ) .
.It ANYWHERE
Allow window to position itself, uncentered.
.It XTERM_FONTADJ
Adjust xterm fonts when resizing.
.It FULLSCREEN
Remove border to allow window to use full screen size.
.El
.Pp
Custom quirks in the configuration file are specified as follows:
.Pp
.Dl quirk[<class>:<name>] = <quirk> [ + <quirk> ... ]
.Pp
.Aq class
and
.Aq name
specify the window to which the quirk(s) apply, and
.Aq quirk
is one of the quirks from the list above.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
quirk[MPlayer:xv] = FLOAT + FULLSCREEN # let mplayer play
quirk[pcb:pcb] = NONE  # remove existing quirk
.Ed
.Pp
You can obtain
.Aq class
and
.Aq name
by running xprop(1) and then clicking on the desired window.
In the following example the main window of Firefox was clicked:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ xprop | grep WM_CLASS
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Navigator", "Firefox"
.Ed
.Pp
Note that grepping for WM_CLASS flips class and name.
In the example above the quirk entry would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
quirk[Firefox:Navigator] = FLOAT
.Ed
.Sh SIGNALS
Sending
.Nm
a HUP signal will retstart it.
