Welcome to Scrotwm's website.<p>
<small>
<a href="scrotwm_es.html">En español</a><p>
Scrotwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11.
It tries to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate can
be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do
any configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and
fast.
<p>
It was largely inspired by 
<a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>
and
<a href="http://www.suckless.org/dwm/">dwm</a>.
Both are fine products but suffer from things like:
crazy-unportable-language-syndrome, silly defaults, asymmetrical window
layout, "how hard can it be?" and good old NIH.
Nevertheless  dwm was a phenomenal resource and many good ideas and code
was borrowed from it.
On the other hand xmonad has great defaults, key bindings and xinerama
support but is crippled by not being written in C.
<p>
Scrotwm is a beautiful pearl!
For it too, was created by grinding irritation.
Nothing is a bigger waste of time than moving windows around until they are the
right size-ish or having just about any relevant key combination being eaten
for some task one never needs.
The path of agony is too long to quote and in classical
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>
fashion (put up, or hack up) a brand new window manager was whooped up to serve
no other purpose than to obey its masters.
It was written by Marco Peereboom, Ryan Thomas McBride &amp; Darrin Chandler and it
is released under the ISC
<a href="license.html">license</a>.
Patches can be accepted provided they are ISC licensed as well.<br>
