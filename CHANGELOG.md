spectrwm 3.0.0
==============

Released on May 2, 2016

We are proud to release spectrwm 3.0.0. Only one major new feature was added
this release that should make spectrwm less quirky when using poorly written,
old X11 and java applications. With the addition of reparenting spectrwm is
now all grown up! In addition, spectrwm is now nearly ICCCM and EWMH compliant.

Minor features/enhancements:

* Add [Online manual](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm/blob/master/spectrwm.html)
* Add fullscreen_toggle action (_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN)
* Send window to next/previous regions workspace
* Add support for _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS

As usual, a bunch of little, and not always obvious, fixes went in as well.
See commit logs for details.

Enjoy!
