spectrwm 3.5.0
==============

Released on Oct 22, 2023

Includes a bunch of major new features and improvements, such as dock/panel
support, an always mapped window mode, floating workspace layout, transparent
color support, tons of fixes, and more!

* Add *free* window mode.
  - *free* windows are floating windows that are not in a workspace. They remain
    mapped and may be resized, positioned and stacked anywhere. When iconified,
    they appear at the end of the uniconify menu. Note that free windows can be
    stacked above/below workspace windows but must be put into a workspace and
    unfloated to be part of its tiling layout. `float_toggle` is convenient for
    this purpose.
  - Add `free_toggle` action (default: `M-S-grave`). Toggle focused window
    between workspace mode and free mode.
  - Add `focus_free` action (default: `M-grave`). Switch focus to/from windows in
    free mode, if any.
  - Add related color and focus mark options.
* Improve EWMH (Extended Window Manager Hints) support.
  - Add support for docks/panels and desktop managers.
  - Add strut support for windows (e.g. panels) to automatically reserve screen
    real estate.
  - Add support for applications to initiate move/resize operations.
  - Add *demands attention* support to urgency features to include windows that
    request focus but are denied.
  - Add support for *below* state to keep windows stacked below others.
  - Improve `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` handling.
  - Fix `_NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT` should update on workspace and region changes.
* Improve window stacking.
  - Overhaul window stacking for improved reliability and flexibility required
    for new features/fixes. Windows are now stacked as a whole instead of per
    region/workspace.
  - Add `click_to_raise` option (default: `1` (enabled)). Raises stacking
    priority when clicking on a window.
  - Add `below_toggle` action (default: `M-S-t`). Toggles *below* state on a
    focused window to keep it below other windows. `raise` can be used to
    temporarily bring a window above all others.
  - Fix `raise` and `always_raise` stacking issues.
  - Fix follow mode stacking issues.
  - Fix stacking order issues.
  - Restore stacking order after leaving fullscreen/maximized state.
* Workaround application issues related to ICCCM 6.3 button grabs.
  - If X Input Extension >= 2.1 is available, handle button bindings with the
    `REPLAY` flag passively, without grabs. For other button bindings, establish
    grabs on root.
  - Otherwise, for compatibility, establish all button binding grabs directly on
    client windows.
* Add alpha transparent color support for use with compositing managers. Colors
  can now be specified with an alpha component via the format
  `rbga:rr/gg/bb/aa` (values in hex.)
* Improve bar fonts.
  - Fallback to a "fail-safe" font if the default/user `bar_font` fails to load.
  - Add fallback handling for missing glyphs when using multiple fonts with Xft.
  - Add supplementary private-use code points to `bar_font_pua`.
  - Fix `$bar_font` program variable substitution should not include fallbacks.
* Improve window mapping.
  - Add `maximize_hide_other` and `fullscreen_hide_other` options. When a
    maximized/fullscreen window is focused, hide unrelated windows on the same
    workspace. Useful for transparent windows.
  - Fix window mapping issue when handling simultaneous screen changes.
  - Improve reliability.
* Improve (re)start handling.
  - Set intial focus more reliably.
  - Focus on fullscreen/maximized windows before main.
  - Restore window floating geometry on shutdown.
* Improve focus handling.
  - Add `prior` setting to `focus_close`. When the focused window is closed,
    fallback to the last focused window in the workspace.
  - Add `focus_prior` action. Focus last focused window on workspace.
    (Default binding: `M-S-a`.)
  - Improve previous focus fallback.
  - Fix iconified window focus issue.
  - Fix input focus fallback.
  - Fix setting focus with EWMH should unmaximize other windows.
  - Fix move/resize operation should abort on focus loss.
  - Fix `focus_main` issue with iconified/floating windows.
  - Fix max layout focus issue when closing transients.
  - Fix `warp_pointer` issues.
* Improve focus follow mode.
  - Fix handling of ConfigureWindow and EWMH requests.
  - Fix workspace switching issues.
* Improve status bar.
  - Add character sequence for workspace list indicator (`+L`).
  - Add workspace mark options for the workspace indicator (`+L`).
  - Add stack mark options for the stacking indicator (`+S`).
  - Add focus mark options for the focus status indicator (`+F`).
  - Add character sequence for number of windows in workspace (`+w`) (lowercase).
  - Add unfocused options to color bar text and background.
  - Add color options for when a window in free mode is focused.
  - Fix `bar_action` piping deadlock issue.
  - Fix `name_workspace` should clear on empty string.
  - Fix refresh bar on `name_workspace`.
  - Set `WM_CLASS`, `WM_NAME` and `_NET_WM_NAME` on the bar window.
* Add `floating` workspace layout stacking mode.
  - In floating layout, windows are not tiled and may be freely moved around
    and resized.
  - Add `stack_mark_floating` option for the stacking indicator
    (default:` '[~]'`).
  - Add `layout_floating` action (default: unbound). Directly switch to floating
    layout.
  - Add `floating` `stack_mode` to the `layout` option.
* Improve max layout.
  - Allow windows to be unmaximized/floated in max layout.
  - Add `max_layout_maximize` option to configure default maximized state.
  - Allow floating windows to remain floating when dragged between regions into
    a max layout workspace.
* Improve window handling.
  - Add *snap* behavior when dragging tiled/maximized windows. Prevents
    accidentally floating tiled windows.
  - Add `snap_range` option (default 25). Sets the pixel distance a
    tiled/maximized window must be dragged (with the pointer) to make it
    float and move freely. Set to 0 to unsnap/float immediately.
  - Add `maximized_unfocus` and `fullscreen_unfocus` options. Configures
    handling of maximized/fullscreen windows that lose focus.
  - Add support for ICCCM `WM_CHANGE_STATE` ClientMessage. Enables applications
    to iconify their own windows.
  - Add support for window gravity. Improves floating window positioning by
    applications.
  - Disable border on maximized windows when `disable_border = always`.
  - Add window titles to `search_win`.
  - Fix maximize handling.
  - Fix handling when a window is lost immediately after ReparentWindow.
  - Fix Java workaround.
* Improve workspace handling.
  - Add `workspace_autorotate` option. When switching workspaces between regions,
    automatically "rotate" vertical/horizontal layouts based on RandR rotation
    data.
  - Add `prior_layout` action. Switch to the last used layout.
    (Unbound by default.)
  - Add optional rotation argument to `region` option.
  - Fix ws cycle actions should skip visible workspaces.
  - Add `cycle_visible` option to the man page and example conf.
* Improve debugging.
  - Add `-d` command-line option to enable debug mode. Enables debug mode
    actions and logging to *stderr* without the need to rebuild with
    `-DSWM_DEBUG`.
  - Add multi-line support to `debug_toggle` overlay (default: `M-d`).
  - Add atom name cache to avoid redundant requests/syncs when printing output.
* Fix X connection error handling to exit on a failed connection.
* Fix build issues.
  - Fix compile error when building against musl.
  - Fix build with clang 16 on Linux.

  isn't a relative/absolute pathname to libswmhack.so, then ld.so attempts to
  load a 32-bit version for 32-bit programs. This produces an error message.
  The solution is to either build and install a 32-bit libswmhack.so.0.0 or use
  an absolute/relative path so that ld.so only loads libswmhack.so for 64-bit
  binaries.
* Update OSX Makefile.

  is less than boundary_width distance beyond the edge.
* Added new boundary_width configuration option. Disable the 'soft boundary'
  behavior by setting this option to 0.
* Added ability to set tile_gap to negative values. This makes it possible for
  tiled windows to overlap. Set to the opposite of border_width to collapse
  borders.

    screen.
  - FOCUSONMAP_SINGLE: When the window is mapped, change focus if it is the
    only mapped window on the workspace using the quirk entry.
* New ws_next_move and ws_prev_move bindings to send a window to the next/prev
  workspace and switch to the workspace.
* Fix fullscreen layout stacking issue when running with multiple regions.
* Fix input focus issue with multiple regions when changing region focus with
  the keyboard.

    MOD-Shift-b.
