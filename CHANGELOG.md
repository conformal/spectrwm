spectrwm 3.0.0
==============

Released on May 2, 2016

We are proud to release spectrwm 3.0.0. Only one major new feature was added
this release that should make spectrwm less quirky when using poorly written,
old X11 and java applications. With the addition of reparenting spectrwm is
now all grown up! In addition, spectrwm is now nearly ICCCM and EWMH compliant.

Minor features/enhancements:

* Add [Online manual](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm/blob/master/spectrwm.html)
* Add fullscreen_toggle action (_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN)
* Send window to next/previous regions workspace
* Add support for _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS

As usual, a bunch of little, and not always obvious, fixes went in as well.
See commit logs for details.

Enjoy!

  isn't a relative/absolute pathname to libswmhack.so, then ld.so attempts to
  load a 32-bit version for 32-bit programs. This produces an error message.
  The solution is to either build and install a 32-bit libswmhack.so.0.0 or use
  an absolute/relative path so that ld.so only loads libswmhack.so for 64-bit
  binaries.
* Update OSX Makefile.

  behavior by setting this option to 0.

  tiled windows to overlap. Set to the opposite of border_width to collapse
  borders.

    only mapped window on the workspace using the quirk entry.
* New ws_next_move and ws_prev_move bindings to send a window to the next/prev
  workspace and switch to the workspace.

  the keyboard.
